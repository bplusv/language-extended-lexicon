The ancient humans were technologically advanced and knew the source \r\nof all creation and destruction, which they called The Vacuum.\r\n\r\nWiles claims that time was measured in months with widely varying numbers of days, \r\ni.e. 12, 34, 17, 9, 15, 8, 42, 40, etc....Peter suspects that the Numbers Broadcasts \r\ncorrespond exactly with the numbers in the book, matching the calendar.\r\n\r\nAstrid doesn\'t buy the claim in the book that an ancient people evolved before dinosaurs,\r\nand then vanished without a trace. Walter has no issue with justifying the disappearance \r\nof the First People - history is full of mass extinction events.\r\n\r\nIn Reciprocity, three more copies of the book are found by Massive Dynamic.\r\nThe three books were written in different languages by three different authors \r\nand published within two years of each other. Brandon claimed that the books were \r\nnot much different from one another paper. \r\n\r\nHe also told Nina that William Bell made the same search a few years ago.\r\nIn Concentrate And Ask Again, Nina Sharp reviews the multiple copies of the book that \r\nhave been quietly secured over the years and stored at Massive Dynamic.\r\nIt dawns on her that the letters in the name of each author are identical.\r\nShe manipulates the letters and finds the name of an old friend.\r\nShe promptly visits Sam Weiss and confronts him with her concerns.\r\nIn 6:02 AM EST, Nina shares what she knows with Olivia about the collection of\r\nFirst People books from around the planet - and the connection they have with Sam Weiss\r\nand the Wave Sink Device.In The Last Sam Weiss, Sam explains that The First People books \r\nare based on an ancient manuscript discovered by the his \r\ngreat-great-great-great-grandfather, Sam Weiss. \r\n\r\nInterim generations continued to search for additional ancient information, \r\nbefore the books were written by the fifth Sam Weiss in the late-1890\'s. \r\nInformation from the ancient manuscript about gaining entry into the Wave Sink Device \r\nonce it was activated was not published in the books.\r\n\r\nSam possesses those ancient writings and uses the knowledge to determine the missing \r\ncomponent to the ancient device - Olivia.In The Day We Died, Walter explains that a time\r\nparadox is responsible for the matter at hand. At some point after May 2026, they will \r\nsend the device that destroyed one universe, and is devastating this universe, \r\ninto the Kappa radiation wormhole in Central Park and back in time 250 million years.\r\n\r\nPeter returns to this time period from 2026 and tells everyone that Walter \r\nis/was/will be \"The First People\", along with maybe Ella and Astrid.\r\n',1),(2,'Wii U','The Wii U ( /ÀåwiÀê ÀàjuÀê/) („Ç¶„Ç£„Éº „É¶„Éº) is an upcoming video game console by Nintendo and will \r\nbe the successor to the Wii.[4] and The system it\'s on the way!...\r\n\r\nThe system was unveiled during Nintendo\'s press conference at the Electronic Entertainment \r\nExpo 2011 on June 7, 2011, and is expected to be released during the fourth quarter of 2012 \r\nin North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.[5] It will be the first entry in the eighth \r\ngeneration of video game consoles.[6][7][8][9]The Wii U also features a new controller, \r\ncalled the GamePad, with an embedded touchscreen. The controller allows a player to continue\r\nplaying certain games by displaying the game even when the television is off. At the E3 2012 expo, a second controller, called the Pro Controller, was unveiled, which is a more traditional gamepad. It features two analog sticks.[10]The system will be backwards compatible with Wii, and Wii U games can support compatibility with Wii peripherals, such as the Wii Remote Plusand the Nunchuk. However, unlike the Wii, the Wii U will not be backwards compatible with Nintendo GameCube discs or peripherals,[11] although games can be purchased and downloaded from Nintendo\'s Virtual Console service.\r\n \r\nThe console was first conceived in 2008,[13] after Nintendo recognized several limitations and challenges with the Wii, such as the general public perception that the system catered primarily for a \"casual\" audience.[14] With Wii U, Nintendo explicitly wishes to lure \"core\" gamers back.[15]Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto admitted that the lack of HD and limited network infrastructure for the Wii also contributed to the system being regarded in a separate class to its competitors\' systems, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[16] It was decided that a new console would have to be made to accommodate significant structural changes.Within the company, there was much debate over the idea for the new console, and the project was scrapped and restarted several times.[17] The concept of a touchscreen embedded within the controller was originally inspired by the blue light on the Wii that illuminates to indicate new messages.[18] Miyamoto and his team wanted to include a small screen to provide game feedback and status messages to players (in similar vein to the VMU for Sega\'s Dreamcast). Much later in development, this was expanded to a full screen that could display the game being played in its entirety, a concept which was suggested but not financially viable earlier in the project.\r\n',1),(3,'another document','\r\nPlot[edit]SettingThe events of the game take place on the fictional Blood Edward island. The game\'s protagonist, Ashley Mizuki Robbins, is the daughter of Richard and Sayoko Robbins, researchers of human memory. After her parents mysteriously went missing in 1994, they were presumed dead.[3] Consequently, Ashley was raised by her father\'s younger sister, Jessica Robbins, in the suburbs of Seattle. Eleven years later, two days before her fourteenth birthday, Ashley receives a package from her father containing a birthday card and a device called a DTS. The DTS, programmed to respond only to Ashley\'s biometrics, contains a message from her father, that claims he is waiting for her on Blood Edward Island.[2][3][edit]StoryThe game\'s protagonist is Ashley Mizuki Robbins, a 13 year old girl who has been raised by her aunt, Jessica, because her parents vanished when she was three years old. She believed that they were dead, but two days before her fourteenth birthday, she received a package. Inside was a letter from her father and a small machine. The letter said that he would be waiting on Blood Edward Island, an island located off the coast of Washington in the United States. The next day, the day before her birthday, Jessica and Ashley ride over to Blood Edward Island on a boat, but Ashley\'s father isn\'t there to greet them. Jessica goes to look for him, but when she doesn\'t return, Ashley ventures out to search for both of them. While exploring the island, Ashley also befriends \"D\", a ghost who has lost his memories. Together they enter the Edward Mansion, each looking for answers to their own questions.\r\n\r\nAt the end of her summer holiday 16 year old Ashley, now an aspiring musician, receives an invitation from her father Richard, who has always been curiously distant towards his daughter. He has been absent as he took over from Ashley‚Äôs mother to work tirelessly on a memory control system known only as ‚ÄúAnother,‚Äù the cause of her mother‚Äôs death.In an effort to cement their bond following his protracted disappearance ‚Äì Richard left Ashley to be brought up by her aunt ‚Äì father and daughter are to spend a weekend together at Lake Juliet, a camping resort. But, as the game begins to unfold, Ashley discovers that there are a series of mysteries surrounding Lake Juliet. The intrigue deepens as she realises she has been to this resort before ‚Ä¶ she has a dim memory of being here just before her mother died 13 years ago.[edit]GameplayPlayers must help Ashley solve a series of clues and puzzles, journeying back into her earliest memories to unlock the past.\r\n\r\nThe story is played as if in the pages of a mystery novel. Ashley must engage with the other characters to follow up the myriad different trails and clues in order to solve the mystery. Journeying through the story‚Äôs digital pages, she will encounter people who clearly know more than they are letting on about the events leading up to her mother‚Äôs death, who she will have to interrogate to glean the information she needs.Players use the Wii Remote to point and click items and characters in the game‚Äôs watercolour backgrounds, interacting with them as she travels. Ashley is guided through the game‚Äôs world by clicking the arrows that tell players where she is able to go. Ashley is assisted in her puzzle solving by her DAS, a portable device with which she can take pictures during the game.By exploring every corner of the world created by the game, collecting items from across it and by combining their intuition and skills in deduction, players will feel like they are themselves characters in a mystery novel as they unravel the secrets of Lake Juliet, Ashley‚Äôs family and ultimately, of Project Another itself.\r\n',2),(4,'Another Document',NULL,1),(5,'binary document',NULL,1),(6,'abyss truth',NULL,1);
