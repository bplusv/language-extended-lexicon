The book describes a race of humans that evolved before the dinosaurs. Only one edition of the book is believed to have been printed. Edward Markham gives Peter Bishop a rare copy of the book so the science team can start solving the puzzling broadcast of numbers over high frequency radio channels.\r\n\r\nOnce the team begins to review the book, they learn the author\'s claim that a cataclysm completely decimated the First People, and any historical record they may have left. The ancient artículo humans were technologically advanced and knew the source of all creation and destruction, which they called The Vacuum. Wiles claims that time was measured in months with widely varying numbers of days, i.e. 12, 34, 17, 9, 15, 8, 42, 40, etc....Peter suspects that the Numbers Broadcasts correspond exactly with the numbers in the book, matching the calendar. Astrid doesn\'t buy the claim in the book that an ancient people evolved before dinosaurs, and then vanished without a trace. Walter has no issue with justifying the disappearance of the First People - history is full of mass extinction events.In Reciprocity, three more copies of the book are found by Massive Dynamic.

At the E3 2012 expo, a second controller, called the Pro Controller, was unveiled, which is a more\r\ntraditional \r\ngamepad. It features two analog sticks.[10]The system will be backwards compatible with Wii, and Wii U games\r\ncan support compatibility with Wii peripherals, such as the Wii Remote Plusand the Nunchuk. However, unlike \r\nthe Wii, the Wii U will not be backwards compatible with Nintendo GameCube discs or peripherals,[11] although \r\ngames can be purchased and downloaded from Nintendo\'s Virtual Console service.\r\n\r\nThe console was first conceived in 2008,[13] after Nintendo recognized several limitations and challenges with \r\nthe Wii, such as the general public perception that the system catered primarily for a \"casual\" audience.[14] \r\nWith Wii U, Nintendo explicitly wishes to lure \"core\" gamers back.[15]Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto admitted\r\nthat the lack of HD and limited network infrastructure for the Wii also contributed to the system being regarded \r\nin a separate class to its competitors\' systems, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[16] It was decided that a new \r\nconsole would have to be made to accommodate significant structural changes.Within the company, there was\r\nmuch debate over the idea for the new console, and the project was scrapped and restarted several times.[17] \r\nThe concept of a touchscreen embedded within the controller was originally inspired by the \r\nblue light on the Wii that illuminates to indicate new messages.[18] Miyamoto and his team wanted to \r\ninclude a small screen to provide game feedback and status messages to players (in similar vein to the \r\nVMU for Sega\'s Dreamcast). \r\n\r\nMuch later in development, this was expanded to a full screen that could display the game being played in \r\nits entirety, a concept which was suggested but not financially viable earlier in the project.\r\n',1),(4,'Another Document',NULL,1),(5,'binary document','0                Is there a something I can put after the .focus() above to prevent further javascript from running and keep the focus on the correct window?

Normalmente su enfermedad no es tan grave como para que estuvieran hospitalizados; sin embargo, resulta conveniente estar monitoreando sus niveles de glucosa frecuentemente.\r\nEllos, normalmente, acuden una vez al mes a una cita y, si están bien ese día o están mal, pues, de eso dependerá el diagnóstico del médico; así como , si siguen con el mism o tratamiento, o lo cambia. Sin embargo, el médico no tiene información de lo que pasó durante todo el mes. Entonces, (el proyecto) consiste en eso, en poder monitorear sus niveles de glucosa de una manera más periódica, tal vez una vez al día o inclusó más.\r\n\r\nEmm:\r\n¿Qué entiende Usted por \"monitorear\"?\r\n\r\nDr.:\r\nMonitorear sus niveles de glucosa, es decir, ellos miden su glucosa cada cierto tiempo (normalmente para diabetes tipo 2, que es la que pretendemos manejar ). Lo hacen dos veces al día o incluso tres: se toman el nivel de glucosa (ya hay glucómetros caseros que permiten hacer eso). Entonces, de eso se trata, de estar viendo la evolución de esos niveles de glucosa diarios.\r\n\r\nEmm:\r\n¿Se pretende que el médico tenga parte activa en el desarrollo de esta aplicación?\r\n\r\nDr.:\r\nPreviamente yo ya tuve entrevistas con algunos médicos y enfermeras que están relacionados con el cuidado de pacientes con diabetes. Ellos ya me han traspasado, lo que yo considero, toda la información necesaria para el desarrollo de la aplicación.\r\n\r\nEmm:\r\n¿Tiene contemplada alguna restricción técnica en el desarrollo del sistema?\r\n\r\nDr.:\r\nComo ya te dije, existen glucómetros caseros que ellos (los pacientes) puedan utilizar, entonces, lo que se está pensando es que se consiga que pueda transmitir información hacia un teléfono. Estamos pensando en una primera aplicación que sería una en la que el paciente fuese el usuario (o un familiar del paciente), en donde esa aplicación recibe el dato que se toma con el glucómetro y, a través de la red celular, pudiera llegar esa información a una base de datos; la otra parte sería en el centro de monitoreo en que se estaría visualizando todos esos datos recibidos de los pacientes. Por otra parte están los médicos quienes, además de tener acceso a ese centro de monitoreo, también a través de su teléfono celular para diferentes plataformas (que podrían ser Blackberry, iPhone o Android) puedan tener, de una manee fácil, acceso a la información de sus pacientes.',6),(11,'Ejemplo','Texto de prueba',7),(12,'E 2',NULL,7),(14,'Términos agregados por el desarrollador','atención médica',6);
